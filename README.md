# OntoVE-Sampo-UI
This semantic portal was built upon the Sampo Model (Ikkala et al. 2022), https://github.com/SemanticComputing/sampo-ui. It presents data related to Cultural Heritage items of Germanic origin linked to the Veneto region. The portal was built within the project The OntoVE project, Ontologies for the description of Germanic Cultural Heritage in Veneto within the perspective of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC); the project is being carried out at Caâ€™ Foscari university of Venice, in close collaboration with a partner IT company, Net7 (https://www.netseven.it/). It is funded by the Italian National Operational Programme (PON, http://www.ponricerca.gov.it/pon-ricerca/programme/) on Research and Innovation 2014-2020 and the European Social Fund (ESF, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/glossary/european-social-fund-esf.html) within the Recovery assistance for cohesion and the territories of Europe (REACT-EU, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/215/recovery-assistance-for-cohesion-and-the-territories-of-europe-react-eu-).
The documentation for the OntoVE ontology can be accessed here: https://w3id.org/ontove/ontology. 

The Sampo model was developed by the Semantic Computing Research Group https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/.
